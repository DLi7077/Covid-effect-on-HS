# Covid-effect-on-HS
Intro to Data Science side project

### website: -> https://dli7077.github.io/highschool_covid/

## A script intended for 1-time use that generates graphs and linear models for highschool data compared to covid-19 cases

If I'm bored, I might:
- Compare rates with death rates/ hospital rates
- Fix the linear model by using train test split
- Use some SVM/ PCV / Kmeans Cluster to attempt to find patterns

Overall:
- Attendance and Graduation Rates can be predicted similarly by either Covid-19 Cases or Year
- The effect (if any) Covid-19 had on highschool attendance/ graduation rates were not prominent/obvious
